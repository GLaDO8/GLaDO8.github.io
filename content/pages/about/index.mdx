I’m a UX Designer and iOS developer studying at <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in" target="_blank">IIIT Bangalore</a>, India.

Currently I’m working with the <a href="https://www.gu.se/en/applied-information-technology/division-of-human-computer-interaction" target="_blank">HCI department at Gothenburg University</a> under Prof. Alexandra Weilenmann. I also volunteer for <a href="http://earthhero.org" target="_blank">EarthHero</a>, an organisation trying to help people track and reduce their carbon emissions, as an iOS developer.

previously I interned with GE Healthcare as a Data Scientist in their services department. I was also the organiser for TEDxIIITBangalore’s very first TEDx event, along with my colleague Tejas Kotha. We both are now mentors for the executive team.

When I’m not working, I like writing, making experimental UIs, rendering weird products on his potato MacBook Pro or rewatching clips from The Office for the millionth time.

Feel free to get in touch with me for freelance work, questions or a quick chat. I’m active on Twitter and strive to maintain inbox zero!
