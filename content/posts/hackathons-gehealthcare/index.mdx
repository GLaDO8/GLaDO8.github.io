We had 8 crushed cans of Red Bulls, 4 packets of half eaten chips, two pairs of drowsy red eyes and 8 hours left. I hadn’t slept in days and all we had seen was code from the past 6 days. This was our first hackathon at GE Healthcare’s JFWTC campus, Bengaluru. 

For students, hackathons are like ice cream trucks — selling swag, goodies and a carnival ticket. They romanticise the world of code and silicon, glittering it with ridiculous dumps of food and cash. The effectiveness of such large scale hackathons to incubate innovation, which depend heavily on extrinsic factors of motivation to attract students, can be debated. Or one could argue that the idea is not to innovate, but to rather encourage students to indulge in this field. Either way, we were sold on the idea. We were desperately looking for one for weeks and luckily fell upon GEHC’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvWekOpNp0s" target="_blank">precision challenge Hackathon</a>. It had an ideation phase followed by a 24-hour on-site implementation challenge. We submitted our proposal within hours and were surprisingly amongst 36 teams all over India invited for the 24-hour coding sprint. 

We made our very first *oopsy* by going to the event with very little preparation, and It’s virtually impossible to complete a data science project with a front-end in a measly 24 hours. Nevertheless, we woke up that morning, barely showered and grabbed an Uber to JFWTC. 

The place was ridiculous. They had this pantry setup with continental breakfast, a mini bakery (nothing was mini about it tbh), juice bar and an ice bowl with dozens of Red Bulls just waiting to get you diabetic. After a small introductory session, we all got our workstations for the rest of the night. 

Things weren’t going well for us. Our idea was to build a dataset generator for dermatology clinics (later expanded to general medical imagery datasets) which will remove any personal identifiers based on <a href="https://www.hipaajournal.com/hipaa-compliance-checklist/" target="_blank">HIPAA regulations</a>. In simpler terms, it was an electron app (geez, I know) in which you dump your images and we will clean it by removing identifiers like eyes, lips, textual information, etc. The problem was that it was just the two of us, and we weren’t familiar with front end very well. I managed to bootstrap together a cleaning engine by midnight and we started working on developing a presentable demo. We had 8 more hours left and we were trying to figure out how to dump our engine output in the app (It’s ridiculously simple btw). I had given up on my dreams of holding a giant cheque like Michael Scott and took a nap, and boy was it a long nap.
