We had 8 crushed cans of Red Bulls, 4 packets of half eaten chips, two pairs of drowsy red eyes and 8 hours left. I hadn’t slept in days and all we had seen was code from the past 6 days. This was our first hackathon at GE Healthcare’s JFWTC campus, Bengaluru. 

For students, hackathons are like ice cream trucks — selling swag, goodies and a ticket to escape the grim realities of the corporate IT industry. They romanticise the world of code and silicon, glittering it with ridiculous dumps of food and cash. OBVIOUSLY we were sold on that idea. We were desperately looking for one and after spending weeks, we luckily fell upon GEHC’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvWekOpNp0s" target="_blank">precision challenge Hackathon</a>. It had an ideation phase followed by a 24-hour on-site implementation challenge. We submitted our proposal within hours and were surprisingly amongst 36 teams all over India invited for the 24-hour coding sprint. 

Now here is where we made our very first *oopsy*. We had done nothing 
It’s virtually impossible to complete a data science project with a front-end in measly 24 hours. But we stuffed all our doubts in a bag, woke up that morning, barely showered and grabbed an Uber to JFWTC. 

The place was ridiculous. They had this pantry setup with continental breakfast, a mini bakery, juice bar and an ice bowl with dozens of Red Bulls just waiting to be slurped on.
