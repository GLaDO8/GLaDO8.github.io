I was on my way down to the common mess at my uni when I read an email stating that our ongoing sports fest has been canceled and the uni is under lockdown. Things got chaotic pretty quickly after that. Students were hoarding the canteen in fear of scarcity and many were in a hurry to leave the campus. Luckily I was able to come back home via road amidst fear of <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/01/how-coronavirus-spreads-on-a-plane/" target="_blank">airborne transmission in flights</a>.

The COVID-19 outbreak has wreck havoc in many countries, especially India, which will be in rubbles if community spread gets serious. A countrywide lockdown was initiated on 22nd March to contain the spread, which has been extended since then to April 14th. The following entries will go about my retrospective thoughts on the various changes that I have incorporated in my daily routine, updates on the outbreak and many more things.

#### Research work, hoardings and fake news

##### 22nd March, day 1

8 hours into the lockdown and I'm already starting to feel claustrophobic. It's weird as I generally think going out is a chore unless we're eating of course. For now, we've stocked up of veggies and eggs but these youtube cooking vids are depleting our stock pretty quickly.

I don't understand why Indians like blowing things out of proportion. The man on the top asks us to clap, and we start performing Garba and have processions of men and women banging kitchen utensils while chanting "go corona, go". Meanwhile, the virus is waiting outside our porch like John Travolta.

#### Housekeeping

##### 24th March, day 3

To ensure the safety of our maids, drivers and even our own, we had to give them paid leave. This means we need to clean our own dishes, do laundry, clean the house and any other chore which you can think of. 2 days in and I can say it with confidence that we are heavily dependent on the so-called "unskilled" labor. Oh how the turntables.

#### Houseparty and until tomorrow

##### 25th March, day 4

Back in October 2018, I downloaded houseparty, a video chat app which is very similar to Snapchat in terms of design, in other words, pathetic. Obviously I deleted it, like I did to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/19/ello-again/" target="_blank">Ello</a>,<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20833903/facebook-instagram-threads-messaging-app-close-friends-snapchat" target="_blank"> Threads</a> by Instagram and devrant. Today morning I saw a couple of Instagram stories of my friends playing Pictionary in a video chat, which turned out to be Houseparty.

Houseparty was woken out of dormancy by kids who've been bored to death amidst the pandemic. The app has peaked the App Store charts in just weeks, surpassing veteran apps like Whatsapp and Instagram who've stayed on top for a long time now.

#### Fake news and the Houseparty scam

##### 31st March, day 10

To ensure the safety of our maids, drivers and even our own, we had to give them paid leave. This means we need to clean our own dishes, do laundry, clean the house and any other chore which you can think of. 2 days in and I can say it with confidence that we are heavily dependent on the so-called "unskilled" labor. Oh how the turntables.

Can we talk about how ridiculously fast information is spreading during this crisis? A lot of discussions opened online in the last two years about fake news and misinformation but I always looked past it until now. Whatsapp has emerged as the de facto standard for sowing the seeds of a fake piece of information, and I'll show you how with 2 incidents which happened this week.

I woke up today morning to my mom screaming on the phone, "Are you serious? She's positive? oh my god!". One of my mom's friends heard about a positive case in the apartment and immediately shared it with everyone. My mom immediately called up the family, who were confused as the kid was totally fine.

I live in Film Nagar, a relatively lavish locality with quite a few places to hang out. We had 6 international travelers in our apartments who returned less than a week back and were under quarantined as per government regulations. They had daily checkups done by GHMC officials who had also put up posters to notify everyone in the apartment/vicinity about these students who have travel history. It's a common protocol being followed in many countries right now. Turns out someone had mass forwarded messages on Whatsapp that our apartment had 6 positive cases and was locked down. Along with it was an image of a metal gate with a huge "Quarantined red zone" banner which wasn't even our gate, and images of the GHMC posters for every traveler.

My Whatsapp inbox blew up by evening. Mom and Dad had to answer around 150 calls and explain how the whole thing is a hoax. There were a few local news websites who were posting about it _(I'm not going to give you a link as I'm not interested in giving them ad revenue)_. It just took around 12 hours for that message to fool hundreds of families and become a

#### Dalgona coffee

##### 1st april, day 11

In today's episode of "Another viral TikTok", let's look at the internet sensation which made people without hand blenders, whip coffee, sugar and water with a freakin' spoon. If you're a millennial like me, you might have already tried your hands at making this, but let me tell you something, I hate this concept. For starters, we need to acknowledge that this is yet another <a href="https://time.com/4789145/avocado-latte-australia/" target="_blank">latte in avocado</a> bullshit by the kids on insta, which means it is the aesthetics and the process which makes it elegant, not the dish itself. The creamy sweet coffee froth looks cute floating on top of the milk and ice slurry, but only till you're done posting a story on insta and sending 178 snaps. I have no clue how people managed to get the coffee to mix with the milk as the low-density froth is extremely adamant about socializing with anything! After battling my mason jar with a spoon for 15 minutes, I threw everything in a blender, something I would've done in the first place if it wasn't for the curse of attention.

#### Self haircut

##### 3rd April, day 13

I woke up today at around 2AM for my usual peeing routine, looked at myself in the mirror and decided, "aight imma give myself a haircut". Whoever tweeted it said it right, We're going to see a lot of bad haircuts after the lockdown is over.
